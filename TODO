- figure out how to handle dubnium extract case i.e. you are connecting to
  host1 in order to run a test for host2, so you need to label the cron job
  with the host2+testname in order to differentiate it, and you want the 
  results posted back to host2/servicename
  i.e. the hostname and service name is different for nagios_http_cronjob
  and nagios_http_result

- add a --mailto argument to check_http_result and nagios_http_cronjob
- figure out how to turn on --extra-opts from within nagios_http_cronjob
